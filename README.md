# Yousef — Portfolio · Blog · Docs

A single Ktor + Summon stack powering three surfaces:

- Portfolio: featured work, services, contact
- Blog: long-form notes and release write-ups (EN/AR)
- Docs: multi-page product manuals with sidebar, search, and deep links

Live:

- https://www.yousef.codes — portfolio, services, blog, admin
- https://summon.yousef.codes — docs (Summon, more coming)

Tech:

- Kotlin (JVM, JS), Ktor, Summon UI, SSR + hydration
- Type-safe modifiers, portals, async validation, and responsive components

Contributing:

- Open issues with a clear scope; include URLs/sections and screenshots if visual
- Localization in EN/AR; match copy tone and direction
